Developed and implemented data models for content moderation and toxicity classification, addressing challenges posed by imbalanced data.
Leveraged Matplotlib for data visualization, conducting insightful statistical analyses to evaluate model performance, identify data trends, and address the imbalance favoring the neutral class.
Utilized machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, LSTM, and Transformer (BERT), to classify toxic comments effectively.
Implemented data preprocessing techniques including lemmatization and stemming
Demonstrated the effectiveness of advanced approaches like BERT in achieving 87% accuracy in toxicity classification, emphasizing the importance of leveraging cutting-edge techniques in data modeling and analytics for content moderation.
